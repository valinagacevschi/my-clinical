      This app is your symptoms and treatment monitor that helps you to keep an 
      asynchronous communication with your doctor. You can complete the evaluation 
      at your convenience and the doctor will be able to review and prioritise 
      your results when back in office.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will help to have your physical follow up appointment based on your 
      clinical needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app has different clinical modules with three components: symptoms 
      assessment, medication compliance and monitoring and notifications.      
    </p>
    
    <h3>Symptoms assessment</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
      You will receive a code with a specific clinical module from your doctor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Can be done quickly, by pressing the large symptoms button. Please answer 
      by pressing green, yellow or red on individual questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the app identifies a change in symptoms, you may be asked to complete 
      a more formal questionnaire, which is usually a validated test tool for 
      your condition.      
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Medication compliance & monitoring</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Your module might have a medication compliance component.</li>
    <li>
      You will need to confirm the administration of the treatment by checking 
      the specific buttons.
    </li>
    <li>You can confirm the administration of the treatment only for the last 24h.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
      The app may send you prompts and notifications to remind you of the time 
      to record symptoms or medications.
    </li>
    <li>
      Depending on your assessment the doctor may send you additional notifications 
      in the form of a coded message. 
    </li>
    <li>You are encouraged to act and confirm the actions required by the notifications.</li>
    </ul>
